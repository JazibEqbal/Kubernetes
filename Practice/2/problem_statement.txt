Problem Statement 2 — Config Management (Mid Level)
Scenario

You are deploying a backend microservice on Kubernetes.

Requirements:

The application needs environment-specific configuration

Configuration values must not be hardcoded in the image

Same container image should work for dev, qa, and prod

Config values may change without rebuilding the image

Configuration needed:

APP_ENV → environment name (dev / qa / prod)

LOG_LEVEL → INFO / DEBUG / ERROR

DB_HOST → database hostname

Your Task

Write only Kubernetes YAML to:

Create a ConfigMap with the above values

Inject these values into a Deployment as environment variables

Run 2 replicas of the application

Expose the app internally on port 8080
