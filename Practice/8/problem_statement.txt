Problem Statement: Kubernetes Requests, Limits & QoS (Resource Optimization)

Scenario:

You are deploying a Java-based microservice in Kubernetes.
The application normally uses 300–400Mi memory
During traffic spikes, it may briefly go up to 700Mi
The node has limited memory and you want to:
Prevent the pod from being OOMKilled
Avoid over-reserving memory (wasting cluster resources)
Ensure this pod gets better priority than best-effort pods

Requirements:
Configure CPU and memory requests & limits appropriately
Ensure the pod falls under the correct QoS(Quality of Service) class

Explain what happens if:
Memory usage crosses the request
Memory usage crosses the limit
Bonus: Add a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler decision:
Should HPA scale on CPU, memory, or both? Why?
