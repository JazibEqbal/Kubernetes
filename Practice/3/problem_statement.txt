Problem Statement 3 — Secrets + Secure Configuration
Scenario

You are deploying a backend application on Kubernetes that connects to a database.

New requirements:

Database username and password are sensitive

They must not be stored in plain text

The same application image must work across environments

Credentials should be injected securely at runtime

Application needs:

DB_USER

DB_PASSWORD

DB_HOST (non-sensitive)

Your Task

Write only Kubernetes YAML to:

Create a Secret to store DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD

Create a ConfigMap for DB_HOST

Inject both Secret and ConfigMap into a Deployment

Run 2 replicas

Expose the application internally on port 8080
