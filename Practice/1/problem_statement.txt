You joined a team where a simple web application (Python/Node/Java — language doesn’t matter) is currently running on a single virtual machine.

The application:

Listens on port 8080

Crashes occasionally

Needs to be highly available

Should automatically restart if it fails

The team wants to move this application to Kubernetes with minimum complexity, but they also want:

The app to restart automatically if it crashes

At least 2 instances running at all times

Traffic to be load-balanced between instances.
