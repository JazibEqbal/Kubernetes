#“A Kubernetes Service provides stable networking and load balancing for a dynamic set of Pods using labels and selectors.”
#🌐Service Types

  # ClusterIP
  # Default service type
  # Exposes service inside the cluster only
  # Used for internal microservice communication

  # NodePort
  # Exposes service on each node’s IP + static port
  # Accessible from outside cluster
  # Port range: 30000–32767

  # LoadBalancer
  # Provisions a cloud load balancer
  # Exposes service externally
  # Common in AWS / GCP / Azure

  # ExternalName
  # Maps service to an external DNS name
  # No selector, no Pods

#🎯Selector & Labels
# selector: Matches Pods using labels i.e, Selector must match Pod labels.
# Service sends traffic only to matching Pods
# No selector → Service doesn’t route traffic

# 🔌 Ports
# port
# Port exposed by the Service

# targetPort
# Port on the Pod/container

# nodePort
# Port exposed on the Node (NodePort service)

# 🌍 Networking Concepts
# Cluster IP
# Virtual IP assigned to the Service
# Stable for service lifetime

# Endpoints / EndpointSlice
# Actual Pod IPs behind the Service
# Updated automatically as Pods change

# kube-proxy
# Implements Service routing
# Uses iptables / IPVS

“Service labels are optional because Services don’t select themselves.
Services use selectors to match Pod labels, not Service labels.”
