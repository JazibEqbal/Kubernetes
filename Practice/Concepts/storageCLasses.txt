Why Kubernetes has StatefulSet + PVC + StorageClass?
    Persistent disk (Persistent means which stays for a long time)
    Stable identity
    Ordered startup/shutdown
    Data survival across restarts

| StorageClass | Disk provisioning policy |
| PVC          | Disk request             |
| PV           | Actual disk              |

What is a StorageClass?
    Answers how storage is created
    A storage template that tells Kubernetes how to create disks when needed.
    Kubernetes creates disks on demand.

What is PVC?
    PersistentVolumeClaim.
    A request for storage by a pod.
    You don’t care: Where the disk lives, Which node
    You care: Size, Access mode, Storage type.
    Pods never talk to disks directly. Pods talk to PVCs.

StatefulSet guarantees:
    Stable pod name
    Stable PVC
    Ordered startup
    Ordered shutdown

Headless Service:
    Load balances randomly. so we use clusterIP: None
    Direct pod access.

| Thing            | Responsibility        |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| StorageClass     | How disks are created |
| PVC              | Disk request          |
| PV               | Actual disk           |
| StatefulSet      | Identity + storage    |
| Headless Service | Direct pod access     |


Use StatefulSet when your application needs any of these:
    * Persistent data (database, message queue, cache with disk)
    * Stable pod identity (`pod-0`, `pod-1` must stay the same)
    * One PVC per pod
    * Ordered startup / shutdown
    * Pod-to-pod communication by fixed name

If your app needs memory of the past → StatefulSet. If it doesn’t → Deployment.**

What Kubernetes does automatically?
| Action             | Result                |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Create StatefulSet | Pods created in order |
| Each pod starts    | PVC auto-created      |
| Pod restarts       | Same PVC reattached   |
| Scale to 4         | New pod + new PVC     |
| Delete pod         | Data survives         |
| Delete StatefulSet | PVCs remain           |
